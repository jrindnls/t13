Teamwork Questionnaire for Justin Daniels

What is your personality type?
ESFP

Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?
Typically easier to reach me via e-mail, followed by text.  I am usually able to respond to e-mails within an hour of receiving them, with the exception of being in a class.  The best times to try to reach me are MWF from 0830 - 0950, 1050 - 1150, 1250 - 1730, and from 2030 to 2300.  On TR, I can be reached from 0830 - 1050, 1215 - 1350, 1700 - 1830, and from 2030 - 2300.

What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
I believe that our team will be able to accomplish a better appreciation for improving communication channels, as well as being able to have an increased level of trust that your teammates will accomplish what they say that they will be able to do.

What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
Personally, I would like to be better able to improve my ability to communicate with my team in more professional terms, rather than using analogies and laymen's terms to describe things.  I would like to be able to commit more time towards working with my group, however, family is the highest priority for me.

What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
As answered above, my family takes priority for me.  I have a 2 year old daughter, and I place her well being above all else.  There are times when I will need to spend less time working on schoolwork to ensure that she has a strong, quality upbringing.

What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
I commend those who strive to achieve an "A", I am one of those people.  However, realistically, "B"s are perfectly acceptable as well.  If that is the level of success that we can achieve during the semester, then so be it.

Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
While I do understand that there may be some who are working extremely hard to get an "A", this is a team based project.  If some team members want to reach out and offer assistance to another member who may be struggling to understand material, or to meet a soft deadline that the group has proposed, I think that is fantastic.  However, if there are members who decide to proceed to complete an entire sprint without collaboration, I feel that it takes away from the spirit of the assignment.

How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
At this time, I believe that the 6 - 8 hour per team member per week contribution will make it successful.  There are a lot of new skills that I will be learning, so I anticipate that at the beginning of the semester, it may take upwards of 10 - 12 hours per week, factoring in mistakes that will be made.

How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
I feel as though we should discuss our individual strengths and weaknesses, and try to create a more balanced team.  For example, I have no experience programming in JavaScript, however, I think that it would be a useful skill to obtain.  I would like to attempt to program a portion of the assignment dedicated to JavaScript, however, those who may have more experience will have to review and help identify errors in coding.  While this may be more time consuming, it would give us the ability to get the most out of our education.

What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
I believe that the team should speak with the person who wasn't able to follow through on a commitment, just to make sure that they are doing well otherwise.  We may need to discuss the level of work that is being shouldered by the person, and adjust accordingly.  If the problem occurs more than once, we will need to bring the issue up with either a TA or the instructor for remediation.

What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
This will inevitably occur.  I believe that first and foremost, we will need to ensure that we are delivering a functional product.  Afterwards, those who are concerned about the quality of work can voice their concerns, and obtain assistance from other members to help elevate different sections of code to reach that level of quality.

How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
As a veteran of the USAF, I worked with different work habits and work ethics on a daily basis.  Ultimately, as long as the job gets done, I have no complaints.  Once deadlines start being broken, or failures to contribute occur, I start to have issues.  At that point, a group discussion may need to occur, barring that, we would need to bring our superiors (i.e. TAs, instructor) in for assistance.

Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
I believe that it would be helpful to have a dedicated hour or two outside of class to meet with team members.  It can be difficult to coordinate, however, based on individual course load and familial matters.

How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
I think an extra day outside of class per week would be sufficient, for an hour or two.  At that stage, it would be to compare notes and ideas for how to address problems.

Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
A certain level of autonomy would be needed, however, if there are team members that I am working closely with on an issue, I don't believe that approval will be needed from every member.  I believe that if there are some drastic changes that need to be made to the project, then a group decision should be made.

What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
Compromises must be made, as well as concessions.  Everyone's voice should be heard during the design process, including personal reservations that one might be feeling.  As the team talks about how they feel that a problem could be approached, it may alleviate concerns that the outlier may have been feeling.

What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
I would ask the person to share their knowledge with the team.  While they may feel confident programming a certain aspect of the project, each member should have the opportunity to try something new this semester.  

What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
I have been in this situation many times.  I am happy trying to facilitate and coordinate between team members, however, if attempts at reaching out are met with silence, then group meetings may proceed without all members being present.  E-mail summaries will be sent to those who were unable to attend.
